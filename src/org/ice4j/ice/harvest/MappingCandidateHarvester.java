/**
 * Uses a list of addresses as a predefined static mask in order to generate
 * {@link TransportAddress}es. This harvester is meant for use in situations
 * where servers are deployed behind a NAT or in a DMZ with static port mapping.
 * <p>
 * Every time the {@link #harvest(Component)} method is called, the mapping
 * harvester will return a list of candidates that provide masked alternatives
 * for every host candidate in the component. Kind of like a STUN server.
 * <p>
 * Example: You run this on a server with address 192.168.0.1, that is behind
 * a NAT with public IP: 93.184.216.119. You allocate a host candidate
 * 192.168.0.1/UDP/5000. This harvester is going to then generate an address
 * 93.184.216.119/UDP/5000
 * <p>
 * This harvester is instant and does not introduce any harvesting latency.
